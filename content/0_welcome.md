# Welcome

This is an **educational site** that explains how **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) works from a technical perspective, with a focus on **Graph RAG**: its architectures, components, and how they fit together.

## What you will find here

- **RAG fundamentals** — How retrieval-augmented generation works: ingestion, indexing, retrieval, and generation.
- **Graph RAG** — Why and how graphs are used in RAG: knowledge graphs, entity relationships, and graph-based retrieval.
- **Architectures** — Different ways to design RAG and Graph RAG systems (pipelines, agents, hybrid setups).
- **Components** — Building blocks: chunking, embeddings, vector stores, graph databases, LLMs, and how they connect.

The content is structured in the **left sidebar**. Use the folders and pages to navigate. Diagrams are interactive: you can **zoom** (scroll), **pan** (drag), and open them in **fullscreen** for a better view.
